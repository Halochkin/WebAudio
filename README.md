# WhatIs: Web audio Api

Web Audio API is a high-level way to create and manage sound directly in a browser using JavaScript. 
It allows you to generate sound from scratch or to download and manipulate any existing audio file you may have. 
It's extremely powerful, even with its own synchronization system for playback per second.
